Code and Resources of the Noise TFG

In this first report, we test the noise sensibility of the CNN model for hand-written fdigit recognition trained with MNIST dataset. This document includes the motivation and process and the repositiory contains also the code used to test the noise exposition and the trained model. This is a raw state of the process and the results can be improved and calculated again exploring more possibilities.
