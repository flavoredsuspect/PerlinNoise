Code and Resources of the Noise TFG

In this first report, we test the noise sensitivity of the CNN model for hand-written fdigit recognition trained with MNIST dataset. This document includes the motivation and process and the repositiory contains also the code used to test the noise exposition and the trained model. This is a raw state of the process and the results can be improved and calculated again exploring more possibilities. 

It is important to remember that the code was made to check the noise sensitivity and therefore is not the fastest nor the more elegant or efficient. This is not necessary due to testing purposes, if the results are convincing and the future path of the working progress points towards this approach, the code may be improved to earn efficiency and better accuracy.
